[CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf)

**I am looking for research opportunities! If you have any leads, please contact me!**

I get my B.Eng. in computer science from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/).

My current research focuses on reconstructing mesh from signed/unsigned distance field. I am also interested in physics simulation, geometry processing, scientific computing, rendering, and other pertinent topics.

Fortunately, I am working as a remote research intern at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) supervised by [Prof.Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/).

Before jumping into science and engineering, I studied art and humanities. If you are curious, please have a look at the [gallery](/gallery/) for (part of) my artworks.
