[CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) â•‘ [GitHub](https://github.com/H-YWu)

**I am looking for research opportunities! If you have any leads, please contact me!**

I get my B.Eng. in computer science from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/).

My current research focuses on reconstructing explicit surface mesh from signed/unsigned distance field. I am also interested in physics-based simulation and rendering, geometry processing, scientific computing, high-performance computing, and other related topics.

Fortunately, I am working as a remote research intern at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) supervised by [Prof.Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/).

Before entering the world of science and engineering, I studied humanities, economics and art. If you are curious, some of my artworks are listed in the [gallery](/gallery/).
